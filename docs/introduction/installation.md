# Installation

To create a new Boardzilla game run the following:

```console
npx @boardzilla/create-game
```

You'll be guided through a series of prompts to being making a new game. One of the choices you'll be prompted with is which game template you'd like to use for your game.
The **[simple template](https://github.com/boardzilla/boardzilla-starter-game)** gives you a very basic game to edit right away. The **[empty template](https://github.com/boardzilla/boardzilla-empty-game)** gives you a completely empty game to start writing into. If this is your first time making a game, the simple template gives you a working example, where as the empty template is more suitable if you've made a game before.

## Running your new game

Once you've created your new game, run the following to start your game:

```console
cd my-game
npm run dev
```

Congrats! Now you'll be able to go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your new game and start developing.
