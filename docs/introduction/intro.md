# Welcome!

To create a game, you create and supply the logic for the game, using
Boardzilla's API to define the board and the the rules.  Boardzilla translates
this into a working browser-based client that show each player what the possible
moves are they have at any given time. It also creates a server that responds to
these moves and updates everyone's game as the players take moves and progress
the game. It displays the board in the way you describe, and uses your CSS to
customize the styling. Boardzilla automatically animates the changes that happen
on the board, but also provides you with ways to add and customize these
animations.
