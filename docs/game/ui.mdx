<Layout/>


## Layout
within the board and within each other. If pieces enter a space,
e.g like cards in a player's hand, the layout you give Boardzilla will tell it
whether these should splay out and stack together, whether they should shrink or
overlap if more are placed into the space than comfortably fit. All this can be
heavily customized depending on the nature of your game.

The layout is essentially an invisible grid where other spaces and pieces are
placed. The grid can grow or shrink depending on how many elements are in it and
where they're placed.

### DOM
The game is displayed in the players browser using HTML and the data tree of the
Board described above is mapped to an actual tree in HTML. If you define a Space
that is a player's hand, with Pieces in them that are cards, then the DOM will
literally have a DOM element for each card as children of the DOM element
representing the hand. The class names of these will match the classes you
provide. So they're easy to target for CSS.
