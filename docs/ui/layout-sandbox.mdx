# Layout sandbox

The best way to explain Boardzilla's layout engine is to experiement. This
sandbox lets you adjust the parameters and add/remove items into a layout for an
imaginary `space` with a square aspect ratio. See the results, and copy the
resultant code to use the layout in your game. Of course, always refer to the
[documentation](../api/modules#layoutattributes) to understand everything that's
going on, as well as a few more options that are not pictured here.

The `area` is treated here as the entire square box. In reality you may set
`area` or `margin` to restrict the layout to a portion of the given space.

import Layout from '@site/src/components/Layout';

<Layout/>
