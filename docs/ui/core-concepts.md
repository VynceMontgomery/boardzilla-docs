# Core concepts

These are some of the basic core concepts of Boardzilla that will be refered to
throughout the documentation.

### Layout
The layout of the game is the definition of where the Spaces and Pieces appear
in the player's browser, and how they change as Pieces are added into an area
and start to fill it up.

Learn more in [Layout](./layout) and also try out the [Layout
sandbox](layout-sandbox).

### Appearance
The appearance of each visible space and piece can be customized using JSX that
you provide, and you can apply any CSS you like to these. You can also supply
special effects that will be applied when things happen to these elements.

Learn more in [Appearance](./appearance).

### Controls
Controls are what we call any floating boxes above the game board. These include:
- Prompts
- Button choices
- Inputs for text or numbers
- Confirmation text and buttons
